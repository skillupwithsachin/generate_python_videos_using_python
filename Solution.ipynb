       "\" if I have to share or if I have to do any kind of you know the image of something so how can I save it any idea so far we talked about doer Hub we talked about how to run a container how to do the image and all those parts and things now my question is if I have to talk about the that we also talked about that how we can build a image and push it to the docker Hub uh now my question is that if I have to talk about that how can we save the image and the container as a tire file or something we talked about this right yeah we can save it how you told with the command uh like Docker save with this we can save our image as a t file yeah Docker export Docker save command okay yeah those are the two command through which we can do this now today we are going to talk about the docker file okay guys what is Docker file and how does it work in these things right the docker file is nothing it's a text file you know which contains like whatever now the operations you have performed all those operations you are putting up in a text file and jotting down it together okay that is your Docker file okay now those instructions are nothing you know it is basically you execute those instructions you write in the particular order and that is how it is written and it creates the images and these things now let's say that if we have to create a image where you have to install a git right what you do you write Docker build G or Docker image git you will pull and then run the container correct correct yeah yeah now what in our case what I'm am going to do is that I have to run or I have to install the git so for that let's say I will install a operating system name as Alpine what I'll do I'll install the operating system Alpine and I will write that okay how can I install the git now you see this is a example of a Docker file okay I will write Run apk update and Run apk G Now APK add G APK update are what those are the two commands for operating system Alpine okay now you can change it based on the ubu based on any other thing correct yeah now once it is done then we can do what we can build this image how we can build using a Docker build command and we can further tag the image where the things are there now once this is done we can create a container and do the things this will help me to do all the things now the point is how can we build a image how can we do all the steps so create a Docker file go to the server or wherever Docker is installed go [Music] there do like I have done through AWS awss [Music] okay yeah right do minus minus version enter okay uh do do PWD go to any home directory right CD hyphen hyphen just write hyy C Hy CD space Hy enter okay so okay that is let just do CD and enter okay home directory that on fine no problem now here write VI Docker file in capital Docker file scho I write down the paste down the those three commands which I have done sent [Music] over I didn't get you what you said in the chat window the content of a Docker file right okay um listen from Alpine yeah okay P there and then hold on I'll tell you what now with this there is one question in the interview which is asked most of the time that what are the default parameters or the attributes or you know the instruction which you have to pass when you write a dogger file now from is what from will tell you that which image has to be used okay Alpine colum 3.5 is what this a image of Alpine OS with version 3.5 run is a command to run the com this any commands and anything right that is one instruction so from run all these are keywords here okay these are the instruction we'll see further more as and then we will move likewise we have one instruction by which is known as maintainer what it is known as maintainer maintainer those keywords should be in a capital or anything huh those keywords run Capital all capital maintainer is also something which is the author okay after maintainer you can give author which will tell you that maintains this file so likewise you have different other parameters which we will talk about okay now save this file okay now Escape colon [Music] WQ see last class only you guys got a good one from like not like any kind of a scolding or something but I was telling you guys last class also that you guys are so weak in Linux so far but still you guys are in the same condition one week gone no progress this show that no study done Escape press Escape now press colon WQ lbo W WQ enter if this would be the situation I'm telling you guys to be honest you have to make your limits very strong if you don't have your Linux strongs any interview go for DeVos interview you go for a CO interview Linux Linux Basics are very important these are are Basics [Music] actually anyways write a command Docker space build space minus t space now give your dockerhub username here email ID that's okay give rajeswar only SL WR Alpine hyen gate hyen hyphen space dot [Music] do do LS here for do one thing move rename the docker file with the only capital D as a [Music] capital hold on how hold on hold on except rajes no one else will tell this to me how can we rename the file in Linux guys if you mind my words right now I don't care mind it but it's high time we are doing this course from last three months we are not aware of the command so far we are almost at the end of the course now Shila what is the command to rename the file sha if you're speaking you're speaking on mute with help what is the command most anit yeah MV command with the help of command sorry I was on mute yeah no as now you get the command write MV space give this Docker file name the file which has to be changed the file which has to be changed space a new name what is this I space the new name of the file which has to be written enter yeah do LS list out the file now you see the change run that Docker build command again okay and press up AR why don't why you have to type it over again and again yeah hit enter now you see so the syntax of the docker file name was wrong that's why it gave you that error okay maximize your screen here what it has done it has basically installed everything with this layers right it has created you know pulled a image in updated the package in my case it is giving error same okay what error uh error response from demon is not running then service status Docker yeah now how can you check uh rajeswari that whether the image has built or not it is running running running SE t dotop hold on one minute yeah how will you check rajeswari what we have to check image you have created right whether the image is installed or not Imes you have the command right and you have this thing also you see the imagees created right about a minute ago yeah so we have this image already created now right so your command ran successfully correct yeah yes okay we have been playing around with doer for quite a bit now we were able to start containers and execut a sh inside those containers now the whole point of thing here is that we have to understand this image layering concept okay in the docker file which is again very very important part each and every Docker file which is running here that is what that is a runnable instance of an image right that is a runable instance of an image which is basically how which is basically being done by some more other this right the uh image layers and these things now the point is that when you create a parent image or you create an image from a Docker file okay the that image is only a read only right means when you create an image so or when you run this Docker file it creates some different layers right every command is done via the layer execution means then you have each and every image or each and everything in a Docker file in a read only and whatever the instruction whatever the things you give for those that is being added and all those those layers are created and these are D when you run the command now the instructions like from run copy add and all those things okay those adds you to the additional layer mainly the instruction like run copy and add those will help you to add a new layer getting it yeah now every layer is read only except the one which is creating a container okay the m is the last layer the last layer is called a container layer what is called container layer now example if you run this create another Docker file now if you have to create a separate Docker file you have to give the either change the path and then created okay for now otherwise you have to give a parameter minus 5 and I think do five okay so this one you're saying this command which you Shar huh yeah make a backup of that Docker file which you created earlier and create a new Docker file with the command which I shared right here have to make a backup huh how to make a backup P move command you have to write the move command move Docker file and write docker file. bku very good rajeswar improve your skill sets otherwise forget run this command I'll be very blunt you might feel it bad right away but this is a you know a bitter truth you have to improve your Linux operating skills yeah that command in the chat window now create a new Docker file with the new content which I put out what you are doing how can you create a new file VI Docker file D capital D capital of Docker file enter paste the contents here now guys in this one you see more instructions right apart from from run add you see that how it is copy and all those things are there getting it guys anything to explain any questions no save this how can you save this we did just before sometime in the class that completely shows how con uh with what Focus we are doing it if we are doing just only for sake of running in the cloud that doesn't going to help you escape colon WQ correct very good go ahead build a image with this one [Music] now change the name of the image now got no problem forget about the copy file right now others has been B done right now every instruction of the docker file whichever you run that has a layer ID every layer generates a unique layer ID if you see with the step one here it generated a layer ID after that full complete right this [Music] one step two this one again generates a layer ID getting it yeah now creating now if you want to look over all these layers of these things together now these layers are like again it's all over creating image but the layers are also helpful right so write a command Docker history and Docker 23 name Docker space enter WR Docker [Music] images was okay write doger history with the blank space for everyone is it the same yeah for me it is demon ER let's see your error also meanwhile rajes look for the option and tell me what is the option share screen for this also it is giving error response from demo yeah what word your name is the same the docker file is not the name right first of all check your repository name no no check your repository name with K contact is it the dockerhub account name yeah yeah yeah now where do Docker file give SL example Alpine or something then do instead of Docker file just write example get or something tell me Docker build minus t wet K contact SL example git dot this one h this is what is the problem it is that lower case letter is required I think I'm that anit what is the what was the problem here in the command H yeah he gave the docker file name instead of the image name andila why this Docker file name Docker file won't work why other name will work uh it works on the images only instead of files no rajes maybe we need to go to the directory again and create new what was my question that why there is not working the command h no but now it worked right but had be a difference only the change in the name the docker file is a keyword guys yeah yeah so it's not how can it take you are defining a Docker file with that right anit but it is continuously it's pointing with invalid argument and giving the argument there for minus t okay not getting the error if any keyword is cled with any it will take it as a invalid any keyword if I use Docker 1 2 3 then also take it will take ER because Raj took I think doer 2 three it is okay it won't give you error at that time tell okay it ran now now you see the layer you saw all the things that's okay now so for seeing all the history of that and these things run Docker history and run Docker images [Music] no run [Music] Docker it's sweet thank you done the docker [Music] history and give the image ID hist is spelling is it the right spelling of History image ID first one first one image ID sir the one which you created right now this is what you created [Music] right getting it guys three different layers has been were part of this right do history and copy the image of [Music] alpide see this okay anyways and we get got it how this layers and how this layer is created the each and every layer is nothing it is a part [Music] of this thing okay each and every command every instruction which you write in a Docker container that is almost a part of Docker layer getting it yeah so these are the means how can you identify read and WR layer here very good now the command to visualize the docker layer right so what anit is asking is that how can I visualize the layers so the command to visualize the layers is run this command like don't run this command just copy and paste this command and do space and write at your W 1 2 three example I'm saying don't run the command just paste that [Music] command there and do space write your that V so 123 whatever it is cre slash example G example hyph get whatever the name you have given enter [Music] then we have to give the image name give the image ID rather than that space image [Music] ID where should I instead of the example ID then a command Docker build minus 3 test image do space enter now done Docker images create that copy file create a file hello. [Music] text what happened create a file with the name is hello. text yeah I was creating that only file created no it is not created why I create a file the touch command man just write touch hello Tex simple command I'm not getting what you asking write touch command t o u c h touch space hello. TC enter [Music] now that done run the build command again this one huh Docker images what is the image name what is the image name guys test image T Test image now run that viralized command and replace the ID with the test image second three for whom you are waiting for Mr with yeah what what you said s an what I have asked to do run that do command again doy RM the visualiz command run that remove the ID give test image enter sorry remove that uh your with Explorer G complete right run this what it has done it opens the sh like but this is a command Docker run minus rmus it minus V that is doing nothing it is mapping the volume volume of server to the cloud okay I'll check why this command is not working but command work okay visualization but I'll take care okay any question so far [Music] so let's create an image right with an instruction add yeah tell me what you are asking what I'm yeah we saw run instruction we saw add instruction we saw copy instruction so far correct in Docker file any problem with that like uh there are some keywords in Docker file right these keywords you are using from run so where we can get more keywords like which we can get through the some other link okay instruction known as command H CMD which you pass in the brackets and you write there like this CMD is nothing that is a command right that okay once you install the image and everything run this command top getting it yeah now let's move on to the next instruction entry point work di directory something that is a current image okay if it is not specified and the default path is root [Music] getting it yeah likewise we have entry point entry point mean that when the things has to work [Music] [Applause] now here if you see is this instruction point or entry point what does it says says that go to the bin Eco and there Eco this cont right you see label maintainer that tells you the build this image anit now it's your done you share your screen and let's see how much comfort would you have so far actually I am not working on laptop currently no electricity P two hours so I joined from Mobile today Sila yeah sain show me how you will build this image I didn't login at all first of all rajar coming back to [Music] you share your screen writing doctor file is very very important I'll share you a lot of examples also for this create a Docker file take the backup of previous one save this file ma'am rajeswar what happened what you are waiting for [Music] correct now build a image first of all do you have given a name itself wrong you have to give a name at Docker file right you cannot give if you're giving a different name then you have to pass the parameter with minus F and this and it sometime doesn't work properly WoW instead of renaming you what you are doing did you do the backup of previous one you got it yes we have to using Mo command we have to rename [Music] that you build of the image hey rajeswari sorry man' but let me write you the commands that we can't waste time for everyone here right sorry use this command repace those commands no no B basically hold on first use this command you didn't put the backup also first use this command then run that command and then run the other Command right yes now run other commands so you see this build a image right this has built a image a Docker image now let's run this container now do Docker image LS let's see how it is let's verify the [Music] image new test image is there right which I have created now run this run a container as soon as you run a container you will [Music] see yeah what you said container copy paste a command now you see we have passed this entry point instruction right that whenever it executes whenever run give execute this right hash B Echo remember yeah yeah is the result of the same only okay now let's talk about quickly the work di right the work di means the work directory instructions which says that whatever the command you are going to run that has to be run from this directory okay that is a present working directory now the whole problem with this is that sorry the whole part with this is that it doesn't create any new layer okay like run add copy those creates new layer right work TI doesn't create any new layer but it just adds a metadata information or it just add the information of this into the docker that okay this work directory has to be used for running the other commands Okay Shila any questions so far no sear yeah I'll share the document also for all this don't worry guys okay don't worry about that now this run instru right runs instruction is something which executes and which creates a new layer now run can be in two parts right the Run can be done in a two parts one is you can directly write this like like like this run and whatever the command is there the same command or sometimes you write in the brackets and all those with the other syntax also getting it yeah if you have to run multiple instructions together at once only you can run like this [Music] also sometimes what happen that you have to create a image with an argument what you have to create an image with an argument example you are creating a image of a Docker file okay where you want to Eco the user okay you want to Eco the user and show some messages okay now everyone sh sh saying rajes take a backup of a existing Docker file quickly hit enter hit enter right yes by right now do V now do one thing now do not VI do greater than symbol SP Docker file this will remove the contents of the file without deleting the file okay guys this will nullify the file nullify means this will delete the contents of the file without deleting the file Docker file is one name with the D capital and a Docker and the file together enter now do write VI Docker file enter copy paste the one which I have put in the chat window yeah control a control C control V that is also taking time for us now you see anit shpa with Focus here the first argument you see what it is argument okay what it is argument oh yeah she copy is not proper you have not even just a yeah not copied the things proper hash you're saying before hash now from the docker file starts from a from the first instruction from to everyone delete everything else in the file yeah oh my God like this you can't delete this put right es press escape and just press Double D keep going like that until everything is [Music] deleted guys today I'm there tell you the commands tomorrow in the interview no one will be there you think about yourselves situations what is the problem rajeswar here in the copy copy the thing in the notepad from the world which is written from Alpine colon 3.9.3 copy the thing there do until CMD cat. text copy the things in the notepad first me see if you're copying it correctly or not great now right now here you see in the maintainer if you guys want you can replace it with your name it is a author name okay Shilpa and other guys here I have given argument one as a welcome user collab NEX you can give other welcome user also and what you are doing you're writing a command that is cat message. text means this instructions right the cat me this instruction which is printed here right welcome an argument name welcome user to the docker world this will go to this and once you create a container or run a container it will print you the message save this file okay run this command to build guys Escape col WQ save run that command copy paste now we had defined already a Docker default option here right after argument colon B1 just press dot just write dot Docker file it has to now we have created an image here right now run this command which will run the container we have created an image with the argument name as a image and V1 is what my version of a image now this time I'm running the image with a default options okay with a default argument on so it gave me a default username that is welcome user what uh to welcome collab to the docker word because default was that now let's say that how we can run with that so when you have copy paste a command when you have to run the image where you have to pass the welcome user argument name or you have to give the value to that you have to give minus minus build minus argument what you have to give minus minus build argument so you see in the command it is written right copy paste that now run the image again and this time you see I have created a version two of the images AR colon V2 this is how you work in the real time just write Docker run ARG AR colon V2 it is run run right now you see it gave me welcome suchin why because I have given the build argument came different this is how you can build the images with your own arguments this is how you can run the images with your own argument and with the different versions getting my point yes yes likewise we have a different set of varieties and you know mechanisms and a place through which you can talk and you can work upon accordingly I'll share you the different formats of a Docker file but again you have to go through more big big Docker files and stuff you have to write you have to see that different instruction which we pass like from run copy add and all those things and this is how this works there are the things which creates a layer there are things which doesn't everything is in a document which will be shared with you so that you understand how the docker file is written and how it is created with a different different ways and I'll sh few GitHub links which will give you other things also getting it yeah so far any questions now in the next class that is tomorrow the class will be only of 1 hour okay and I'm preponing a Class 1 hour before as I have to go somewhere at around 3:00 so we'll be having a 2 to 3 only so 2: p.m. I actually tomorrow class okay just for tomorrow so fine with you guys right yeah now we will be doing what that we will be creating a private Docker registry tomorrow we'll talk about a Docker networking and Docker volumes the other three important things we'll talk about that how we can create a private Docker registry okay right now whatever the docker registry mean Docker Hub W part which we did yesterday in last class that was my public registry which was open to everyone probably right by default private we will create so that it will be exposed to us only no one else can see it okay like you do in the corporates then we talk about Docker volume and then we'll talk about Docker networking and if I forget just remind me that how can I talk about the ECR that is elastic container registry which is in AWS okay y yeah will finish my okay Docker completely tomorrow we talked about so far that how we can we started with creating a dockerhub account we started with running a container running the images how you can work with the images create the images save the images how you can uh push it to the Hub then we move to the containers we talked about how we can run the containers what's the difference between the few commands of the containers how we can inspect the images and the containers can get the other attributes how we can access the container shell or go inside the container how we can run the commands and all those things and these things and then we talked about the docker file today we talked about the you know the uh we're going to talk about Docker volume Docker networking and private Docker registry these are the few components which are very very important for the docker to start with and to understander so how are guys how was session apart from my shouting any other thing I really find it very bad that when you guys don't work with the commands properly especially rajeswar for you this is something you have to very yeah I need to go through the commands again have to otherwise very difficult for you hello okay how was the session anit and something new yeah yeah I it was very good session I learned so many like Docker file commands which we used to run like run command entry point and label all these things actually I did one spring boot on this only Docker file so with with that also like I learned three to four commands how to create our owning boot image great Shila I think you are joining first class of today's do so you are able to cope up get it yeah yeah I have gone through previous recorded sessions I am uh yeah getting it but yeah I need to go through it uh one or two times more again okay thank you but any questions from you yes it is new for me I have to go to yeah more and more practice will help us to do this I'll share you guys the assignment and other things also everything for this I have a very good notes please like this I'm quite occupied with some of you know office but I'll share with you guys okay anyway so I think we are good with the things okay let's meet up again tomorrow same time same sorry 2 p.m. IST and uh let's wrap up Docker and then we'll talk about further things okay thank you yeah okay thanks guys\""

      "okay these are the instruction we'll see further more as\n",
      "and then we will move likewise we have one instruction by which is known as maintainer what it is known as maintainer maintainer those keywords should be in a capital or anything huh those keywords run Capital all capital maintainer is also something which is the author okay after maintainer you can give author which will tell you that maintains this file so likewise you have different other parameters which we will talk about\n",
      "okay now save this file\n",
      "okay now Escape colon [Music] WQ see last class only you guys got a good one from like not like any kind of a scolding or something\n",
      "but I was telling you guys last class also that you guys are so weak in Linux so far but still you guys are in the same condition one week gone no progress this show that no study done Escape press Escape now press colon WQ lbo W WQ enter if this would be the situation I'm telling you guys to be honest you have to make your limits very strong if you don't have your Linux strongs any interview go for DeVos interview you go for a CO interview Linux Linux Basics are very important these are are Basics\n",
      "[Music] actually anyways write a command Docker space build space minus t space now give your dockerhub username here email ID that's okay give rajeswar only SL WR Alpine hyen gate hyen hyphen space dot\n",
      "[Music] do do LS here for do one thing move rename the docker file with the only capital D as a [Music] capital hold on how hold on hold on except rajes no one else will tell this to me how can we rename the file in Linux guys if you mind my words right now I don't care mind it\n",
      "but it's high time we are doing this course from last three months we are not aware of the command so far we are almost at the end of the course now Shila what is the command to rename the file sha if you're speaking you're speaking on mute with help what is the command\n",
      "most anit\n",
      "yeah MV command with the help of command\n",
      "sorry I was on mute\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "no\n",
      "as now you get the command write MV space give this Docker file name the file which has to be changed the file which has to be changed space a new name what is this I space the new name of the file which has to be written enter\n",
      "yeah do LS list out the file now you see the change run that Docker build command again\n",
      "okay\n",
      "and press up AR why don't why you have to type it over again and again\n",
      "yeah hit enter now you see so the syntax of the docker file name was wrong that's why it gave you that error\n",
      "okay maximize your screen here what it has done it has basically installed everything with this layers right it has created you know pulled a image in updated the package in my case it is giving error same\n",
      "okay\n",
      "what error uh error response from demon is not running then service status Docker\n",
      "yeah now how can you check uh rajeswari that whether the image has built or not it is running running running SE t dotop hold on one minute\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "how will you check rajeswari what we have to check image you have created right whether the image is installed or not Imes you have the command\n",
      "right\n",
      "and you have this thing also you see the imagees created right about a minute ago\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "so we have this image already created now\n",
      "right so your command ran successfully correct\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "yes\n",
      "okay we have been playing around with doer for quite a bit now we were able to start containers and execut a sh inside those containers now the whole point of thing here is that we have to understand this image layering concept okay in the docker file which is again very very important part each and every Docker file which is running here that is what that is a runnable instance of an image right that is a runable instance of an image which is basically how which is basically being done by some more other this\n",
      "right the uh image layers and these things now the point is that when you create a parent image or you create an image from a Docker file\n",
      "okay the that image is only a read only right means when you create an image\n",
      "so or when you run this Docker file it creates some different layers right every command is done via the layer execution means then you have each and every image or each and everything in a Docker file in a read only and whatever the instruction whatever the things you give for those that is being added and all those those layers are created and these are D when you run the command now the instructions like from run copy add and all those things\n",
      "okay those adds you to the additional layer mainly the instruction like run copy and add those will help you to add a new layer getting it\n",
      "yeah now every layer is read only except the one which is creating a container\n",
      "okay the m is the last layer the last layer is called a container layer what is called container layer now example if you run this create another Docker file now if you have to create a separate Docker file you have to give the either change the path and then created okay for now otherwise you have to give a parameter minus 5\n",
      "and I think do five\n",
      "okay\n",
      "so this one you're saying this command which you\n",
      "Shar\n",
      "huh yeah make a backup of that Docker file which you created earlier and create a new Docker file with the command which I shared right here have to make a backup\n",
      "huh how to make a backup P move command you have to write the move command move Docker file and write docker file.\n",
      "bku very good rajeswar improve your skill sets otherwise forget run this command I'll be very blunt you might feel it bad right away but this is a you know a bitter truth you have to improve your Linux operating skills\n",
      "yeah that command in the chat window now create a new Docker file with the new content which I put out what you are doing how can you create a new file VI Docker file D capital D capital of Docker file enter paste the contents here now guys in this one you see more instructions right apart from from run add you see that how it is copy and all those things are there getting it guys anything to explain any questions no save this how can you save this we did just before sometime in the class that completely shows how con uh with what Focus we are doing it if we are doing just only for sake of running in the cloud that doesn't going to help you escape colon WQ correct very good go ahead build a image with this one\n",
      "[Music] now change the name of the image now got no problem forget about the copy file right now others has been B done right now every instruction of the docker file whichever you run that has a layer ID every layer generates a unique layer ID if you see with the step one here it generated a layer ID after that full complete right this\n",
      "[Music] one step two this one again generates a layer ID getting it\n",
      "yeah now creating now if you want to look over all these layers of these things together now these layers are like again it's all over creating image but the layers are also helpful\n",
      "right so write a command Docker history and Docker 23 name Docker space enter WR Docker\n",
      "[Music] images was okay write doger history with the blank space for everyone is it the same\n",
      "yeah for me it is\n",
      "demon ER let's see your error also meanwhile rajes look for the option and tell me what is the option share screen for this also it is giving error response from demo\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "what word your name is the same the docker file is not the name right first of all check your repository name\n",
      "no\n",
      "no check your repository name with K contact is it\n",
      "the dockerhub account name\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "now where do Docker file give SL example Alpine or something then do instead of Docker file just write example get or something tell me Docker build minus t wet K contact SL example git dot\n",
      "this one h this is what is the problem it is that lower case letter is required I think I'm that anit what is the what was the problem here in the command H\n",
      "yeah he gave the docker file name instead of the image name andila why this Docker file name Docker file won't work why other name will work uh it works on the images only instead of files no rajes maybe we need to go to the directory again and create new what was my question that why there is not working the command\n",
      "h\n",
      "no\n",
      "but now it worked right but had be a difference only the change in the name the docker file is a keyword guys\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "so it's not how can it take you are defining a Docker file with that right anit\n",
      "but it is continuously it's pointing with invalid argument and giving the argument there for minus t okay not getting the error if any keyword is cled with any it will take it as a invalid any keyword if I use Docker 1 2 3 then also take it will take ER because Raj took I think doer 2 three it is\n",
      "okay it won't give you error at that time tell\n",
      "okay it ran now now you see the layer you saw all the things that's okay now\n",
      "so for seeing all the history of that and these things run Docker history and run Docker images [Music] no run\n",
      "[Music] Docker it's sweet thank you done the docker\n",
      "[Music] history and give the image ID hist is spelling is it the right spelling of History image ID first one first one image ID sir the one which you created right now this is what you created [Music] right getting it guys three different layers has been were part of this right do history and copy the image of [Music] alpide see this\n",
      "okay anyways\n",
      "and we get got it how this layers and how this layer is created the each and every layer is nothing it is a part\n",
      "[Music] of this thing\n",
      "okay each and every command every instruction which you write in a Docker container that is almost a part of Docker layer getting it\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "so these are the means how can you identify read and WR layer here very good now the command to visualize the docker layer\n",
      "right so what anit is asking is that how can I visualize the layers so the command to visualize the layers is run this command like don't run this command just copy and paste this command and do space and write at your W 1 2 three example I'm saying don't run the command just paste that [Music] command there and do space write your that V so 123\n",
      "whatever it is cre slash example G example hyph get whatever the name you have given enter [Music] then we have to give the image name give the image ID rather than\n",
      "that space image\n",
      "[Music] ID where should I instead of the example\n",
      "ID then a command Docker build minus 3 test image do space enter now done Docker images create that copy file create a file hello.\n",
      "[Music] text what happened create a file with the name is hello.\n",
      "text\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "I was creating that only file created no it is not created why I create a file the touch command man just write touch\n",
      "hello Tex simple command I'm not getting what you asking write touch command t o u c h touch space\n",
      "hello.\n",
      "TC enter [Music] now that done run the build command again this one\n",
      "huh Docker images what is the image name what is the image name guys test image T Test image now run that viralized command and replace the ID with the test image second three for whom you are waiting for Mr with\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "what what you said s an what I have asked to do run that do command again doy RM the visualiz command run that remove the ID give test image enter sorry remove that uh your with Explorer G complete right run this what it has done it opens the sh like\n",
      "but this is a command Docker run minus rmus it minus V that is doing nothing it is mapping the volume volume of server to the cloud\n",
      "okay\n",
      "I'll check why this command is not working but command work\n",
      "okay visualization\n",
      "but I'll take care\n",
      "okay any question so far\n",
      "[Music] so let's create an image right with an instruction add\n",
      "yeah tell me what you are asking what I'm\n",
      "yeah we saw run instruction we saw add instruction we saw copy instruction so far correct in Docker file any problem with that like uh there are some keywords in Docker file right these keywords you are using from run so where we can get more keywords like which we can get through the some other link okay instruction known as command H CMD which you pass in the brackets\n",
      "and you write there like this CMD is nothing that is a command right that\n",
      "okay once you install the image and everything run this command top getting it\n",
      "yeah now let's move on to the next instruction entry point work di directory something that is a current image\n",
      "okay if it is not specified and the default path is root\n",
      "[Music] getting it\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "likewise we have entry point entry point mean that when the things has to work [Music]\n",
      "[Applause] now here if you see is this instruction point or entry point what does it says says that go to the bin Eco and there Eco this cont\n",
      "right you see label maintainer that tells you the build this image anit now it's your done you share your screen and let's see how much comfort would you have so far actually I am not working on laptop currently no electricity P\n",
      "two hours so I joined from Mobile today\n",
      "Sila\n",
      "yeah sain show me how you will build this image I didn't login at all first of all rajar coming back to [Music] you share your screen writing doctor file is very very important I'll share you a lot of examples also for this create a Docker file take the backup of previous one save this file ma'am rajeswar what happened what you are waiting for [Music] correct now build a image first of all do you have given a name itself wrong you have to give a name at Docker file right you cannot give if you're giving a different name then you have to pass the parameter with minus F and this\n",
      "and it sometime doesn't work properly WoW instead of renaming you what you are doing did you do the backup of previous one you got it\n",
      "yes we have to using Mo command we have to rename [Music] that you build of the image\n",
      "hey rajeswari sorry man' but let me write you the commands that we can't waste time for everyone here\n",
      "right sorry use this command repace those commands no no B basically hold on first use this command you didn't put the backup also first use this command then run that command and then run the other Command\n",
      "right yes now run other commands so you see this build a image\n",
      "right this has built a image a Docker image now let's run this container now do Docker image LS let's see how it is let's verify the [Music] image new test image is there right which I have created now run this run a container as soon as you run a container you will\n",
      "[Music] see\n",
      "yeah what you said container copy paste a command now you see we have passed this entry point instruction\n",
      "right that whenever it executes whenever run give execute this right hash B Echo remember\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "yeah is the result of the same\n",
      "only okay now let's talk about quickly the work di right the work di means the work directory instructions which says that whatever the command you are going to run that has to be run from this directory\n",
      "okay that is a present working directory now the whole problem with this is that sorry the whole part with this is that it doesn't create any new layer\n",
      "okay like run add copy those creates new layer right work TI doesn't create any new layer but it just adds a metadata information or it just add the information of this into the docker\n",
      "that okay this work directory has to be used for running the other commands\n",
      "Okay Shila any questions so far no sear\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "I'll share the document also for all this don't worry guys okay don't worry about that now this run instru right runs instruction is something which executes and which creates a new layer now run can be in two parts right the Run can be done in a two parts one is you can directly write this like like like this run and whatever the command is there the same command or sometimes you write in the brackets and all those with the other syntax also getting it\n",
      "yeah if you have to run multiple instructions together at once only you can run like this [Music] also sometimes what happen that you have to create a image with an argument what you have to create an image with an argument example you are creating a image of a Docker file okay where you want to Eco the user\n",
      "okay you want to Eco the user and show some messages\n",
      "okay now everyone sh sh saying rajes take a backup of a existing Docker file quickly hit enter hit enter\n",
      "right yes by right now do V now do one thing now do not VI do greater than symbol SP Docker file this will remove the contents of the file without deleting the file okay guys this will nullify the file nullify means this will delete the contents of the file without deleting the file Docker file is one name with the D capital and a Docker and the file together enter now do write VI Docker file enter copy paste the one which I have put in the chat window\n",
      "yeah control a control C control V that is also taking time for us now you see anit shpa with Focus here the first argument you see what it is argument\n",
      "okay what it is argument\n",
      "oh yeah\n",
      "she copy is not proper you have not even just a yeah not copied the things proper hash you're saying before hash now from the docker file starts from a from the first instruction from to everyone delete everything else in the file\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "oh my God like this you can't delete this put right es press escape and just press Double D keep going like that until everything is [Music] deleted guys today I'm there tell you the commands tomorrow in the interview no one will be there you think about yourselves situations what is the problem rajeswar here in the copy copy the thing in the notepad from the world which is written from Alpine colon 3.9.3 copy the thing there do until CMD cat. text copy the things in the notepad first me see if you're copying it correctly or not great now right now here you see in the maintainer if you guys want you can replace it with your name it is a author name\n",
      "okay Shilpa and other guys here I have given argument one as a welcome user collab NEX you can give other welcome user also and what you are doing you're writing a command that is cat message.\n",
      "text means this instructions right the cat me this instruction which is printed here right welcome an argument name welcome user to the docker world this will go to this and once you create a container or run a container it will print you the message save this file\n",
      "okay run this command to build guys Escape col WQ save run that command copy paste now we had defined already a Docker default option here right after argument colon B1 just press dot just write dot Docker file it has to now we have created an image here right now run this command which will run the container we have created an image with the argument name as a image and V1 is what my version of a image now this time I'm running the image with a default options okay with a default argument on so it gave me a default username that is welcome user\n",
      "what uh to welcome collab to the docker word because default was that now let's say that how we can run with that so when you have copy paste a command when you have to run the image where you have to pass the welcome user argument name or you have to give the value to that you have to give minus minus build minus argument what you have to give minus minus build argument so you see in the command it is written right copy paste that now run the image again and this time you see I have created a version two of the images AR colon V2\n",
      "this is how you work in the real time just write Docker run ARG AR colon V2 it is run run right now you see it gave me welcome suchin why because I have given the build argument came different this is how you can build the images with your own arguments this is how you can run the images with your own argument and with the different versions getting my point\n",
      "yes\n",
      "yes likewise we have a different set of varieties and you know mechanisms and a place through which you can talk\n",
      "and you can work upon accordingly I'll share you the different formats of a Docker file\n",
      "but again you have to go through more big big Docker files and stuff you have to write you have to see that different instruction which we pass like from run copy add and all those things and this is how this works there are the things which creates a layer there are things which doesn't everything is in a document which will be shared with you so that you understand how the docker file is written and how it is created with a different different ways and I'll sh few GitHub links which will give you other things also getting it\n",
      "yeah so far any questions now in the next class that is tomorrow the class will be only of 1 hour\n",
      "okay\n",
      "and I'm preponing a Class 1 hour before as I have to go somewhere at around 3:00\n",
      "so we'll be having a 2 to 3 only so 2: p.m.\n",
      "I actually tomorrow class okay just for tomorrow so fine with you guys right\n",
      "yeah now we will be doing what that we will be creating a private Docker registry tomorrow we'll talk about a Docker networking and Docker volumes the other three important things we'll talk about that how we can create a private Docker registry\n",
      "okay\n",
      "right now whatever the docker registry mean Docker Hub W part which we did yesterday in last class that was my public registry which was open to everyone probably right by default private we will create so that it will be exposed to us only no one else can see it\n",
      "okay like you do in the corporates then we talk about Docker volume and then we'll talk about Docker networking and if I forget just remind me that how can I talk about the ECR that is elastic container registry which is in AWS\n",
      "okay\n",
      "y\n",
      "yeah will finish my okay Docker completely tomorrow we talked about so far that how we can we started with creating a dockerhub account we started with running a container running the images how you can work with the images create the images save the images how you can uh push it to the Hub then we move to the containers we talked about how we can run the containers what's the difference between the few commands of the containers how we can inspect the images and the containers can get the other attributes how we can access the container shell or go inside the container how we can run the commands and all those things and these things and then we talked about the docker file today we talked about the you know the uh we're going to talk about Docker volume Docker networking and private Docker registry these are the few components which are very very important for the docker to start with and to understander\n",
      "so how are guys how was session apart from my shouting any other thing I really find it very bad that when you guys don't work with the commands properly especially rajeswar for you this is something you have to very\n",
      "yeah I need to go through the commands again have to otherwise very difficult for you\n",
      "hello\n",
      "okay how was the session anit and something\n",
      "new\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "I it was very good session\n",
      "I learned so many like Docker file commands which we used to run like run command entry point and label all these things actually I did one spring boot on this only Docker file so with with that also like I learned three to four commands how to create our owning boot image\n",
      "great Shila I think you are joining first class of today's do so you are able to cope up get it\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "I have gone through previous recorded sessions I am uh yeah getting it\n",
      "but\n",
      "yeah I need to go through it uh one or two times more again\n",
      "okay thank you\n",
      "but any questions from you\n",
      "yes it is new for me I have to go to yeah more and more practice will help us to do this I'll share you guys the assignment and other things also everything for this I have a very good notes please like this I'm quite occupied with some of you know\n",
      "office\n",
      "but I'll share with you guys\n",
      "okay\n",
      "anyway\n",
      "so I think we are good with the things\n",
      "okay let's meet up again tomorrow same time same sorry 2 p.m. IST and uh let's wrap up Docker\n",
      "and then we'll talk about further things\n",
      "okay thank you\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "okay\n",

       " right: 0.7530864197530864,\n",
       " yeah we can save it how you told with the command uh like Docker save with this we can save our image as a t file: 4.679012345679011,\n",

       " yeah those are the two command through which we can do this now today we are going to talk about the docker file okay guys what is Docker file and how does it work in these things right the docker file is nothing it's a text file you know which contains like whatever now the operations you have performed all those operations you are putting up in a text file and jotting down it together: 10.666666666666663,\n",
       " okay that is your Docker file: 2.0987654320987654,\n",
       " okay now those instructions are nothing you know it is basically you execute those instructions you write in the particular order and that is how it is written: 1.6419753086419755,\n",
       " and it creates the images and these things now let's say that if we have to create a image where you have to install a git: 2.0617283950617282,\n",
       " right: 0.7530864197530864,\n",

       " yeah: 0.7037037037037037,\n",
       " now what in our case what I'm am going to do is that I have to run or I have to install the git so for that let's say I will install a operating system name as Alpine what I'll do: 1.382716049382716,\n",
       " I'll install the operating system Alpine: 0.16049382716049382,\n",

       " how can I install the git now you see this is a example of a Docker file: 1.5185185185185186,\n",
       " okay I will write Run apk update and Run apk G Now APK add G APK update are what those are the two commands for operating system: 3.2962962962962967,\n",
       " okay now you can change it based on the ubu based on any other thing correct: 1.1604938271604937,\n",
       " yeah now once it is done then we can do what we can build this image how we can build using a Docker build command: 3.407407407407407,\n",
       " and we can further tag the image where the things are there now once this is done we can create a container and do the things this will help me to do all the things now the point is how can we build a image how can we do all the steps so create a Docker file go to the server or wherever Docker is installed go: 5.666666666666667,\n",

       " no problem now here write VI Docker file in capital Docker file scho I write down the paste down the those three commands which I have done sent [Music] over I didn't get you what you said in the chat window the content of a Docker file: 5.098765432098766,\n",
       " right: 0.7530864197530864,\n",

       " okay: 0.8395061728395061,\n",
       " P there and then hold on I'll tell you what now with this there is one question in the interview which is asked most of the time that what are the default parameters or the attributes or you know the instruction which you have to pass when you write a dogger file now from is what from will tell you that which image has to be used okay Alpine colum 3.5 is what this a image of Alpine OS with version 3.5 run is a command to run the com this any commands and anything right that is one instruction so from run all these are keywords here: 9.530864197530864,\n",
       " okay these are the instruction we'll see further more as: 1.0864197530864197,\n",
       " and then we will move likewise we have one instruction by which is known as maintainer what it is known as maintainer maintainer those keywords should be in a capital or anything huh those keywords run Capital all capital maintainer is also something which is the author okay after maintainer you can give author which will tell you that maintains this file so likewise you have different other parameters which we will talk about: 4.493827160493827,\n",
       " okay now save this file: 2.0,\n",
       " okay now Escape colon [Music] WQ see last class only you guys got a good one from like not like any kind of a scolding or something: 2.160493827160494,\n",
       " but I was telling you guys last class also that you guys are so weak in Linux so far but still you guys are in the same condition one week gone no progress this show that no study done Escape press Escape now press colon WQ lbo W WQ enter if this would be the situation I'm telling you guys to be honest you have to make your limits very strong if you don't have your Linux strongs any interview go for DeVos interview you go for a CO interview Linux Linux Basics are very important these are are Basics: 2.333333333333333,\n",
       " [Music] actually anyways write a command Docker space build space minus t space now give your dockerhub username here email ID that's okay give rajeswar only SL WR Alpine hyen gate hyen hyphen space dot: 3.864197530864198,\n",
       " [Music] do do LS here for do one thing move rename the docker file with the only capital D as a [Music] capital hold on how hold on hold on except rajes no one else will tell this to me how can we rename the file in Linux guys if you mind my words right now I don't care mind it: 4.185185185185185,\n",
       " but it's high time we are doing this course from last three months we are not aware of the command so far we are almost at the end of the course now Shila what is the command to rename the file sha if you're speaking you're speaking on mute with help what is the command: 3.9012345679012346,\n",
       " most anit: 0.08641975308641975,\n",

       " yeah do LS list out the file now you see the change run that Docker build command again: 3.8888888888888884,\n",
       " okay: 0.8395061728395061,\n",
       " and press up AR why don't why you have to type it over again and again: 0.08641975308641975,\n",
       " yeah hit enter now you see so the syntax of the docker file name was wrong that's why it gave you that error: 2.395061728395062,\n",
       " okay maximize your screen here what it has done it has basically installed everything with this layers right it has created you know pulled a image in updated the package in my case it is giving error same: 3.2716049382716057,\n",
       " okay: 0.8395061728395061,\n",
       " what error uh error response from demon is not running then service status Docker: 0.8518518518518519,\n",
       " yeah now how can you check uh rajeswari that whether the image has built or not it is running running running SE t dotop hold on one minute: 2.432098765432099,\n",
       " yeah: 0.7037037037037037,\n",
       " how will you check rajeswari what we have to check image you have created right whether the image is installed or not Imes you have the command: 3.6543209876543212,\n",
       " right: 0.7530864197530864,\n",
       " and you have this thing also you see the imagees created right about a minute ago: 1.123456790123457,\n",
       " yeah: 0.7037037037037037,\n",
       " so we have this image already created now: 1.0493827160493827,\n",
       " right so your command ran successfully correct: 1.6666666666666665,\n",
       " yeah: 0.7037037037037037,\n",
       " yes: 0.08641975308641975,\n",
       " okay we have been playing around with doer for quite a bit now we were able to start containers and execut a sh inside those containers now the whole point of thing here is that we have to understand this image layering concept okay in the docker file which is again very very important part each and every Docker file which is running here that is what that is a runnable instance of an image right that is a runable instance of an image which is basically how which is basically being done by some more other this: 8.50617283950617,\n",
       " right the uh image layers and these things now the point is that when you create a parent image or you create an image from a Docker file: 6.012345679012346,\n",
       " okay the that image is only a read only right means when you create an image: 3.7283950617283947,\n",
       " so or when you run this Docker file it creates some different layers right every command is done via the layer execution means then you have each and every image or each and everything in a Docker file in a read only and whatever the instruction whatever the things you give for those that is being added and all those those layers are created and these are D when you run the command now the instructions like from run copy add and all those things: 10.876543209876544,\n",
       " okay those adds you to the additional layer mainly the instruction like run copy and add those will help you to add a new layer getting it: 3.753086419753086,\n",
       " yeah now every layer is read only except the one which is creating a container: 1.3703703703703702,\n",
       " okay the m is the last layer the last layer is called a container layer what is called container layer now example if you run this create another Docker file now if you have to create a separate Docker file you have to give the either change the path and then created okay for now otherwise you have to give a parameter minus 5: 8.024691358024691,\n",
       " and I think do five: 0.07407407407407407,\n",
       " okay: 0.8395061728395061,\n",
       " so this one you're saying this command which you: 0.8395061728395061,\n",
       " huh yeah make a backup of that Docker file which you created earlier and create a new Docker file with the command which I shared right here have to make a backup: 5.753086419753087,\n",
       " huh how to make a backup P move command you have to write the move command move Docker file and write docker file.: 4.925925925925926,\n",
       " bku very good rajeswar improve your skill sets otherwise forget run this command I'll be very blunt you might feel it bad right away but this is a you know a bitter truth you have to improve your Linux operating skills: 2.864197530864198,\n",
       " yeah that command in the chat window now create a new Docker file with the new content which I put out what you are doing how can you create a new file VI Docker file D capital D capital of Docker file enter paste the contents here now guys in this one you see more instructions right apart from from run add you see that how it is copy and all those things are there getting it guys anything to explain any questions no save this how can you save this we did just before sometime in the class that completely shows how con uh with what Focus we are doing it if we are doing just only for sake of running in the cloud that doesn't going to help you escape colon WQ correct very good go ahead build a image with this one: 13.691358024691354,\n",
       " [Music] now change the name of the image now got no problem forget about the copy file right now others has been B done right now every instruction of the docker file whichever you run that has a layer ID every layer generates a unique layer ID if you see with the step one here it generated a layer ID after that full complete right this: 8.17283950617284,\n",
       " [Music] one step two this one again generates a layer ID getting it: 0.5061728395061729,\n",

       " this one h this is what is the problem it is that lower case letter is required I think I'm that anit what is the what was the problem here in the command H: 1.2716049382716048,\n",
       " yeah he gave the docker file name instead of the image name andila why this Docker file name Docker file won't work why other name will work uh it works on the images only instead of files no rajes maybe we need to go to the directory again and create new what was my question that why there is not working the command: 7.962962962962964,\n",
       " h: 0.037037037037037035,\n",

       " [Music] so let's create an image right with an instruction add: 2.4814814814814814,\n",
       " yeah tell me what you are asking what I'm: 0.8518518518518519,\n",
       " yeah we saw run instruction we saw add instruction we saw copy instruction so far correct in Docker file any problem with that like uh there are some keywords in Docker file right these keywords you are using from run so where we can get more keywords like which we can get through the some other link okay instruction known as command H CMD which you pass in the brackets: 10.209876543209875,\n",
       " and you write there like this CMD is nothing that is a command right that: 2.2098765432098766,\n",
       " okay once you install the image and everything run this command top getting it: 3.4938271604938267,\n",
       " yeah now let's move on to the next instruction entry point work di directory something that is a current image: 2.530864197530864,\n",
       " okay if it is not specified and the default path is root: 0.9876543209876543,\n",
       " [Music] getting it: 0.16049382716049382,\n",
       " yeah: 0.7037037037037037,\n",
       " likewise we have entry point entry point mean that when the things has to work [Music]: 1.0246913580246912,\n",
       " [Applause] now here if you see is this instruction point or entry point what does it says says that go to the bin Eco and there Eco this cont: 0.691358024691358,\n",
       " right you see label maintainer that tells you the build this image anit now it's your done you share your screen and let's see how much comfort would you have so far actually I am not working on laptop currently no electricity P: 2.6790123456790127,\n",
       " two hours so I joined from Mobile today: 0.08641975308641975,\n",
       " yeah sain show me how you will build this image I didn't login at all first of all rajar coming back to [Music] you share your screen writing doctor file is very very important I'll share you a lot of examples also for this create a Docker file take the backup of previous one save this file ma'am rajeswar what happened what you are waiting for [Music] correct now build a image first of all do you have given a name itself wrong you have to give a name at Docker file right you cannot give if you're giving a different name then you have to pass the parameter with minus F and this: 10.000000000000004,\n",
       " and it sometime doesn't work properly WoW instead of renaming you what you are doing did you do the backup of previous one you got it: 0.4691358024691358,\n",
       " yes we have to using Mo command we have to rename [Music] that you build of the image: 2.037037037037037,\n",
       " hey rajeswari sorry man' but let me write you the commands that we can't waste time for everyone here: 0.9753086419753085,\n",
       " right sorry use this command repace those commands no no B basically hold on first use this command you didn't put the backup also first use this command then run that command and then run the other Command: 6.91358024691358,\n",
       " right yes now run other commands so you see this build a image: 2.91358024691358,\n",
       " right this has built a image a Docker image now let's run this container now do Docker image LS let's see how it is let's verify the [Music] image new test image is there right which I have created now run this run a container as soon as you run a container you will: 11.148148148148149,\n",
       " yeah what you said container copy paste a command now you see we have passed this entry point instruction: 2.5925925925925926,\n",
       " right that whenever it executes whenever run give execute this right hash B Echo remember: 2.3950617283950617,\n",
       " yeah: 0.7037037037037037,\n",
       " yeah is the result of the same: 0.7160493827160495,\n",
       " only okay now let's talk about quickly the work di right the work di means the work directory instructions which says that whatever the command you are going to run that has to be run from this directory: 5.469135802469136,\n",
       " okay that is a present working directory now the whole problem with this is that sorry the whole part with this is that it doesn't create any new layer: 1.9753086419753083,\n",
       " okay like run add copy those creates new layer right work TI doesn't create any new layer but it just adds a metadata information or it just add the information of this into the docker: 5.098765432098764,\n",
       " that okay this work directory has to be used for running the other commands: 1.4320987654320985,\n",
       " Okay Shila any questions so far no sear: 1.0123456790123457,\n",
       " yeah: 0.7037037037037037,\n",
       " I'll share the document also for all this don't worry guys okay don't worry about that now this run instru right runs instruction is something which executes and which creates a new layer now run can be in two parts right the Run can be done in a two parts one is you can directly write this like like like this run and whatever the command is there the same command or sometimes you write in the brackets and all those with the other syntax also getting it: 10.358024691358024,\n",
       " yeah if you have to run multiple instructions together at once only you can run like this [Music] also sometimes what happen that you have to create a image with an argument what you have to create an image with an argument example you are creating a image of a Docker file okay where you want to Eco the user: 8.765432098765432,\n",
       " okay you want to Eco the user and show some messages: 0.9876543209876543,\n",
       " okay now everyone sh sh saying rajes take a backup of a existing Docker file quickly hit enter hit enter: 2.9135802469135808,\n",
       " right yes by right now do V now do one thing now do not VI do greater than symbol SP Docker file this will remove the contents of the file without deleting the file okay guys this will nullify the file nullify means this will delete the contents of the file without deleting the file Docker file is one name with the D capital and a Docker and the file together enter now do write VI Docker file enter copy paste the one which I have put in the chat window: 14.493827160493828,\n",
       " yeah control a control C control V that is also taking time for us now you see anit shpa with Focus here the first argument you see what it is argument: 1.4691358024691359,\n",
       " okay what it is argument: 1.0493827160493827,\n",
       " oh yeah: 0.7283950617283951,\n",
       " she copy is not proper you have not even just a yeah not copied the things proper hash you're saying before hash now from the docker file starts from a from the first instruction from to everyone delete everything else in the file: 4.0246913580246915,\n",
       " yeah: 0.7037037037037037,\n",
       " oh my God like this you can't delete this put right es press escape and just press Double D keep going like that until everything is [Music] deleted guys today I'm there tell you the commands tomorrow in the interview no one will be there you think about yourselves situations what is the problem rajeswar here in the copy copy the thing in the notepad from the world which is written from Alpine colon 3.9.3 copy the thing there do until CMD cat. text copy the things in the notepad first me see if you're copying it correctly or not great now right now here you see in the maintainer if you guys want you can replace it with your name it is a author name: 5.938271604938271,\n",
       " okay Shilpa and other guys here I have given argument one as a welcome user collab NEX you can give other welcome user also and what you are doing you're writing a command that is cat message.: 2.666666666666667,\n",
       " text means this instructions right the cat me this instruction which is printed here right welcome an argument name welcome user to the docker world this will go to this and once you create a container or run a container it will print you the message save this file: 5.604938271604939,\n",
       " okay run this command to build guys Escape col WQ save run that command copy paste now we had defined already a Docker default option here right after argument colon B1 just press dot just write dot Docker file it has to now we have created an image here right now run this command which will run the container we have created an image with the argument name as a image and V1 is what my version of a image now this time I'm running the image with a default options okay with a default argument on so it gave me a default username that is welcome user: 18.444444444444446,\n",
       " what uh to welcome collab to the docker word because default was that now let's say that how we can run with that so when you have copy paste a command when you have to run the image where you have to pass the welcome user argument name or you have to give the value to that you have to give minus minus build minus argument what you have to give minus minus build argument so you see in the command it is written right copy paste that now run the image again and this time you see I have created a version two of the images AR colon V2: 11.037037037037036,\n",
       " this is how you work in the real time just write Docker run ARG AR colon V2 it is run run right now you see it gave me welcome suchin why because I have given the build argument came different this is how you can build the images with your own arguments this is how you can run the images with your own argument and with the different versions getting my point: 7.049382716049383,\n",
       " yes: 0.08641975308641975,\n",
       " yes likewise we have a different set of varieties and you know mechanisms and a place through which you can talk: 0.5925925925925926,\n",
       " and you can work upon accordingly I'll share you the different formats of a Docker file: 1.728395061728395,\n",
       " but again you have to go through more big big Docker files and stuff you have to write you have to see that different instruction which we pass like from run copy add and all those things and this is how this works there are the things which creates a layer there are things which doesn't everything is in a document which will be shared with you so that you understand how the docker file is written and how it is created with a different different ways and I'll sh few GitHub links which will give you other things also getting it: 6.45679012345679,\n",
       " yeah so far any questions now in the next class that is tomorrow the class will be only of 1 hour: 1.2222222222222223,\n",

       " yeah now we will be doing what that we will be creating a private Docker registry tomorrow we'll talk about a Docker networking and Docker volumes the other three important things we'll talk about that how we can create a private Docker registry: 3.2592592592592586,\n",
       " okay: 0.8395061728395061,\n",

       " okay like you do in the corporates then we talk about Docker volume and then we'll talk about Docker networking and if I forget just remind me that how can I talk about the ECR that is elastic container registry which is in AWS: 2.6296296296296298,\n",

       " yeah will finish my okay Docker completely tomorrow we talked about so far that how we can we started with creating a dockerhub account we started with running a container running the images how you can work with the images create the images save the images how you can uh push it to the Hub then we move to the containers we talked about how we can run the containers what's the difference between the few commands of the containers how we can inspect the images and the containers can get the other attributes how we can access the container shell or go inside the container how we can run the commands and all those things and these things and then we talked about the docker file today we talked about the you know the uh we're going to talk about Docker volume Docker networking and private Docker registry these are the few components which are very very important for the docker to start with and to understander: 11.580246913580247,\n",
       " so how are guys how was session apart from my shouting any other thing I really find it very bad that when you guys don't work with the commands properly especially rajeswar for you this is something you have to very: 1.2839506172839508,\n",
       " yeah I need to go through the commands again have to otherwise very difficult for you: 0.9259259259259258,\n",

       "\"okay run this command to build guys Escape col WQ save run that command copy paste now we had defined already a Docker default option here right after argument colon B1 just press dot just write dot Docker file it has to now we have created an image here right now run this command which will run the container we have created an image with the argument name as a image and V1 is what my version of a image now this time I'm running the image with a default options okay with a default argument on so it gave me a default username that is welcome user right yes by right now do V now do one thing now do not VI do greater than symbol SP Docker file this will remove the contents of the file without deleting the file okay guys this will nullify the file nullify means this will delete the contents of the file without deleting the file Docker file is one name with the D capital and a Docker and the file together enter now do write VI Docker file enter copy paste the one which I have put in the chat window yeah that command in the chat window now create a new Docker file with the new content which I put out what you are doing how can you create a new file VI Docker file D capital D capital of Docker file enter paste the contents here now guys in this one you see more instructions right apart from from run add you see that how it is copy and all those things are there getting it guys anything to explain any questions no save this how can you save this we did just before sometime in the class that completely shows how con uh with what Focus we are doing it if we are doing just only for sake of running in the cloud that doesn't going to help you escape colon WQ correct very good go ahead build a image with this one yeah will finish my okay Docker completely tomorrow we talked about so far that how we can we started with creating a dockerhub account we started with running a container running the images how you can work with the images create the images save the images how you can uh push it to the Hub then we move to the containers we talked about how we can run the containers what's the difference between the few commands of the containers how we can inspect the images and the containers can get the other attributes how we can access the container shell or go inside the container how we can run the commands and all those things and these things and then we talked about the docker file today we talked about the you know the uh we're going to talk about Docker volume Docker networking and private Docker registry these are the few components which are very very important for the docker to start with and to understander right this has built a image a Docker image now let's run this container now do Docker image LS let's see how it is let's verify the [Music] image new test image is there right which I have created now run this run a container as soon as you run a container you will what uh to welcome collab to the docker word because default was that now let's say that how we can run with that so when you have copy paste a command when you have to run the image where you have to pass the welcome user argument name or you have to give the value to that you have to give minus minus build minus argument what you have to give minus minus build argument so you see in the command it is written right copy paste that now run the image again and this time you see I have created a version two of the images AR colon V2 so or when you run this Docker file it creates some different layers right every command is done via the layer execution means then you have each and every image or each and everything in a Docker file in a read only and whatever the instruction whatever the things you give for those that is being added and all those those layers are created and these are D when you run the command now the instructions like from run copy add and all those things yeah those are the two command through which we can do this now today we are going to talk about the docker file okay guys what is Docker file and how does it work in these things right the docker file is nothing it's a text file you know which contains like whatever now the operations you have performed all those operations you are putting up in a text file and jotting down it together right so what anit is asking is that how can I visualize the layers so the command to visualize the layers is run this command like don't run this command just copy and paste this command and do space and write at your W 1 2 three example I'm saying don't run the command just paste that [Music] command there and do space write your that V so 123 I'll share the document also for all this don't worry guys okay don't worry about that now this run instru right runs instruction is something which executes and which creates a new layer now run can be in two parts right the Run can be done in a two parts one is you can directly write this like like like this run and whatever the command is there the same command or sometimes you write in the brackets and all those with the other syntax also getting it yeah we saw run instruction we saw add instruction we saw copy instruction so far correct in Docker file any problem with that like uh there are some keywords in Docker file right these keywords you are using from run so where we can get more keywords like which we can get through the some other link okay instruction known as command H CMD which you pass in the brackets yeah sain show me how you will build this image I didn't login at all first of all rajar coming back to [Music] you share your screen writing doctor file is very very important I'll share you a lot of examples also for this create a Docker file take the backup of previous one save this file ma'am rajeswar what happened what you are waiting for [Music] correct now build a image first of all do you have given a name itself wrong you have to give a name at Docker file right you cannot give if you're giving a different name then you have to pass the parameter with minus F and this P there and then hold on I'll tell you what now with this there is one question in the interview which is asked most of the time that what are the default parameters or the attributes or you know the instruction which you have to pass when you write a dogger file now from is what from will tell you that which image has to be used okay Alpine colum 3.5 is what this a image of Alpine OS with version 3.5 run is a command to run the com this any commands and anything right that is one instruction so from run all these are keywords here yeah if you have to run multiple instructions together at once only you can run like this [Music] also sometimes what happen that you have to create a image with an argument what you have to create an image with an argument example you are creating a image of a Docker file okay where you want to Eco the user okay we have been playing around with doer for quite a bit now we were able to start containers and execut a sh inside those containers now the whole point of thing here is that we have to understand this image layering concept okay in the docker file which is again very very important part each and every Docker file which is running here that is what that is a runnable instance of an image right that is a runable instance of an image which is basically how which is basically being done by some more other this [Music] now change the name of the image now got no problem forget about the copy file right now others has been B done right now every instruction of the docker file whichever you run that has a layer ID every layer generates a unique layer ID if you see with the step one here it generated a layer ID after that full complete right this I learned so many like Docker file commands which we used to run like run command entry point and label all these things actually I did one spring boot on this only Docker file so with with that also like I learned three to four commands how to create our owning boot image [Music] history and give the image ID hist is spelling is it the right spelling of History image ID first one first one image ID sir the one which you created right now this is what you created [Music] right getting it guys three different layers has been were part of this right do history and copy the image of [Music] alpide see this okay the m is the last layer the last layer is called a container layer what is called container layer now example if you run this create another Docker file now if you have to create a separate Docker file you have to give the either change the path and then created okay for now otherwise you have to give a parameter minus 5 yeah he gave the docker file name instead of the image name andila why this Docker file name Docker file won't work why other name will work uh it works on the images only instead of files no rajes maybe we need to go to the directory again and create new what was my question that why there is not working the command so how can I save it any idea so far we talked about doer Hub we talked about how to run a container how to do the image and all those parts and things now my question is if I have to talk about the that we also talked about that how we can build a image and push it to the docker Hub uh now my question is that if I have to talk about that how can we save the image and the container as a tire file or something we talked about this this is how you work in the real time just write Docker run ARG AR colon V2 it is run run right now you see it gave me welcome suchin why because I have given the build argument came different this is how you can build the images with your own arguments this is how you can run the images with your own argument and with the different versions getting my point right sorry use this command repace those commands no no B basically hold on first use this command you didn't put the backup also first use this command then run that command and then run the other Command huh Docker images what is the image name what is the image name guys test image T Test image now run that viralized command and replace the ID with the test image second three for whom you are waiting for Mr with what what you said s an what I have asked to do run that do command again doy RM the visualiz command run that remove the ID give test image enter sorry remove that uh your with Explorer G complete right run this what it has done it opens the sh like as now you get the command write MV space give this Docker file name the file which has to be changed the file which has to be changed space a new name what is this I space the new name of the file which has to be written enter but again you have to go through more big big Docker files and stuff you have to write you have to see that different instruction which we pass like from run copy add and all those things and this is how this works there are the things which creates a layer there are things which doesn't everything is in a document which will be shared with you so that you understand how the docker file is written and how it is created with a different different ways and I'll sh few GitHub links which will give you other things also getting it ID then a command Docker build minus 3 test image do space enter now done Docker images create that copy file create a file hello. right the uh image layers and these things now the point is that when you create a parent image or you create an image from a Docker file oh my God like this you can't delete this put right es press escape and just press Double D keep going like that until everything is [Music] deleted guys today I'm there tell you the commands tomorrow in the interview no one will be there you think about yourselves situations what is the problem rajeswar here in the copy copy the thing in the notepad from the world which is written from Alpine colon 3.9.3 copy the thing there do until CMD cat. text copy the things in the notepad first me see if you're copying it correctly or not great now right now here you see in the maintainer if you guys want you can replace it with your name it is a author name huh yeah make a backup of that Docker file which you created earlier and create a new Docker file with the command which I shared right here have to make a backup and we can further tag the image where the things are there now once this is done we can create a container and do the things this will help me to do all the things now the point is how can we build a image how can we do all the steps so create a Docker file go to the server or wherever Docker is installed go text means this instructions right the cat me this instruction which is printed here right welcome an argument name welcome user to the docker world this will go to this and once you create a container or run a container it will print you the message save this file only okay now let's talk about quickly the work di right the work di means the work directory instructions which says that whatever the command you are going to run that has to be run from this directory no problem now here write VI Docker file in capital Docker file scho I write down the paste down the those three commands which I have done sent [Music] over I didn't get you what you said in the chat window the content of a Docker file okay like run add copy those creates new layer right work TI doesn't create any new layer but it just adds a metadata information or it just add the information of this into the docker huh how to make a backup P move command you have to write the move command move Docker file and write docker file. yeah we can save it how you told with the command uh like Docker save with this we can save our image as a t file and then we will move likewise we have one instruction by which is known as maintainer what it is known as maintainer maintainer those keywords should be in a capital or anything huh those keywords run Capital all capital maintainer is also something which is the author okay after maintainer you can give author which will tell you that maintains this file so likewise you have different other parameters which we will talk about now where do Docker file give SL example Alpine or something then do instead of Docker file just write example get or something tell me Docker build minus t wet K contact SL example git dot [Music] do do LS here for do one thing move rename the docker file with the only capital D as a [Music] capital hold on how hold on hold on except rajes no one else will tell this to me how can we rename the file in Linux guys if you mind my words right now I don't care mind it I was creating that only file created no it is not created why I create a file the touch command man just write touch she copy is not proper you have not even just a yeah not copied the things proper hash you're saying before hash now from the docker file starts from a from the first instruction from to everyone delete everything else in the file but it's high time we are doing this course from last three months we are not aware of the command so far we are almost at the end of the course now Shila what is the command to rename the file sha if you're speaking you're speaking on mute with help what is the command yeah do LS list out the file now you see the change run that Docker build command again [Music] actually anyways write a command Docker space build space minus t space now give your dockerhub username here email ID that's okay give rajeswar only SL WR Alpine hyen gate hyen hyphen space dot okay those adds you to the additional layer mainly the instruction like run copy and add those will help you to add a new layer getting it okay the that image is only a read only right means when you create an image how will you check rajeswari what we have to check image you have created right whether the image is installed or not Imes you have the command so for seeing all the history of that and these things run Docker history and run Docker images [Music] no run okay once you install the image and everything run this command top getting it okay each and every command every instruction which you write in a Docker container that is almost a part of Docker layer getting it yeah now once it is done then we can do what we can build this image how we can build using a Docker build command right so write a command Docker history and Docker 23 name Docker space enter WR Docker okay I will write Run apk update and Run apk G Now APK add G APK update are what those are the two commands for operating system okay maximize your screen here what it has done it has basically installed everything with this layers right it has created you know pulled a image in updated the package in my case it is giving error same yeah now we will be doing what that we will be creating a private Docker registry tomorrow we'll talk about a Docker networking and Docker volumes the other three important things we'll talk about that how we can create a private Docker registry what you do you write Docker build G or Docker image git you will pull and then run the container correct correct okay now everyone sh sh saying rajes take a backup of a existing Docker file quickly hit enter hit enter right yes now run other commands so you see this build a image bku very good rajeswar improve your skill sets otherwise forget run this command I'll be very blunt you might feel it bad right away but this is a you know a bitter truth you have to improve your Linux operating skills yeah now creating now if you want to look over all these layers of these things together now these layers are like again it's all over creating image but the layers are also helpful right now whatever the docker registry mean Docker Hub W part which we did yesterday in last class that was my public registry which was open to everyone probably right by default private we will create so that it will be exposed to us only no one else can see it right you see label maintainer that tells you the build this image anit now it's your done you share your screen and let's see how much comfort would you have so far actually I am not working on laptop currently no electricity P okay Shilpa and other guys here I have given argument one as a welcome user collab NEX you can give other welcome user also and what you are doing you're writing a command that is cat message. but it is continuously it's pointing with invalid argument and giving the argument there for minus t okay not getting the error if any keyword is cled with any it will take it as a invalid any keyword if I use Docker 1 2 3 then also take it will take ER because Raj took I think doer 2 three it is hello Tex simple command I'm not getting what you asking write touch command t o u c h touch space okay like you do in the corporates then we talk about Docker volume and then we'll talk about Docker networking and if I forget just remind me that how can I talk about the ECR that is elastic container registry which is in AWS yeah what you said container copy paste a command now you see we have passed this entry point instruction yeah now let's move on to the next instruction entry point work di directory something that is a current image [Music] so let's create an image right with an instruction add\""
